# Env Tab Labeler Privacy Policy

Env Tab Labeler keeps all configuration in Chrome Sync storage so that your rules, colors, and toggle preferences follow you between browsers signed into the same Google account.

- We do not collect, transmit, or store personal data on any external server.
- The extension never reads or persists page content, browsing history, form data, or user identifiers.
- All settings remain under your control inside Chrome; you can clear them at any time via **chrome://settings/syncSetup** or by removing the extension.

If you have any questions about this policy, open an issue on the project repository.
